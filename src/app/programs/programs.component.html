  <p>Our youth program is divided into three sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <span class="emphasis">
      <li>Cat Kids (ages 5-9)</li>
      <li>Junior Panthers (ages 9-12)</li>
      <li>Panthers (ages 12-15)</li>
    </span>
  </ul>
</div>
  <p>
    The youth program takes students from white belt through junior black belt.
    In the first two stages of learning, our classes emphasize:
  </p>
    <ol>
      <li>strong boudaries against bully behavior</li>
      <li>respect for classmates</li>
      <li>training partner saftey</li>
      <li>mental focus</li>
      <li>sustained attention</li>
      <li>athletic work-ethic</li>
      <li>growth mindset</li>
    </ol>
  <p>
    As students becomes more confident in the basic movements and skills of the
    martial arts, we teach them to verbally, and if necessary, physically stand
    against bully aggression and use their self-assurance to take on positive
    leadership roles in the dojo, in school, and in their community.
